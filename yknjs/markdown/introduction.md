* Some of you have probably seen Game of Thrones and you are familiar
with the title of this presentation. Ygritte, in the picture, was
a remarkable woman who lived north of the Wall. Throughout the series
she says "You know nothing, Jon Snow!" several times.
* Jon is one of the main characters, and Jon knows a lot of things.
He is a skilled swordsman, he has a political and a strategic mind,
he has charisma and leadership skills.
* But when Jon is faced with a new situation, meeting new cultures, like
the Wildings, that he does not understand, he looks like a newb.
However, soon enough, his skills and previous experience will help him
to understand and deal with the new cultures.

I think this analogy fits people starting to work with OpenStack.
You probably worked as a sysadmin, did your share of troubleshooting
Linux services, you can read a log file. When you first start working
with OpenStack it is overwhelming. It's a multitude of projects, and
it's hard to find what's wrong before gaining some experience.

This is a session about troubleshooting, and I will share some of my
personal experiences, hoping my advice helps.
My name is Elena Lindqvist and I work for City Network.

<!-- Note -->
City Network is a company based in Sweden, with about 50 employees.
City Network is a Cloud Service Provider and our competition is
AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure, amongst others.
It's crazy, isn't it ? :)


I'm a troubleshooter
<!-- Note -->
I'm a troubleshooter and I worked in the front lines for many years,
interacting with demanding customers and fixing the problems they reported.

<!-- Note -->
* "Demanding" means: Operators from Japan, that expect details, and
details of details, to accompany any technical solution.
* Or  American telecom operators, keen on overly detailed written
procedures, with a lengthy approval chain, before they apply any
change in their live systems.
