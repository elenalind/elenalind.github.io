Problem-Solving Strategies & Methods
<!-- Note -->
There are many problem-solving strategies and methods. I wish I could
state that I found the three-steps approach that solves any OpenStack
problem as much as I wish I could say I found a one-page solution to
Fermat's last theorem, you know:

<!-- Note -->
You know it, right? There is no integer grater than 2 that is a solution
for this equation.
There is no silver bullet when solving a problem in an OpenStack cloud,
and it took 300 years, 100 pages, and a remarkable person, like Andrew
Wiles, to come up with the proof for this theorem.


1. Define the problem
2. Establish a few hypotheses of a possible cause
3. Test these hypotheses
4. Apply the solution
5. Document the solution

<!-- Note -->
In this talk, I will present three problems and the steps I follow
to solve a problem, which are:

1. Define the problem
2. Establish a few hypotheses of a possible cause
3. Test these hypotheses
4. Apply the solution
5. Document the solution

Let's look at some problems now!
