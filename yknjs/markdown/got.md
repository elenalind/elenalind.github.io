Hello everyone, and welcome to this talk!

Some of you have probably seen Game of Thrones. Ygritte says, "You know
 nothing, Jon Snow!" several times throughout the series. But, what does
she mean with that?

Well, Jon knows a lot of things. He is a skilled swordsman, he has a
political and a strategic mind, he has charisma and leadership skills.
But when Jon is faced with a new situation, meeting a new culture like
the Wildings, that he does not understand, he looks like a newb.

However, soon enough, his skills and previous experience will help him
to understand and deal with this new culture.
